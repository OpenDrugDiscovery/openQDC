# How to Add a Dataset to OpenQDC

Do you think that OpenQDC is missing some important dataset? Do you think your dataset would be a good fit for OpenQDC? 
If so, you can contribute to OpenQDC by adding your dataset to the OpenQDC repository in two ways:

1. Opening a PR to add a new dataset
2. Request a new dataset through Google Form

## OpenQDC PR Guidelines

## OpenQDC Google Form

Alternatively, you can ask the OpenQDC main development team to take care of the dataset upload for you. 
You can fill out the Google Form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeh0YHRn-OoqPpUbrL7G-EOu3LtZC24rtQWwbjJaZ-2V8P2vQ/viewform?usp=sf_link)

As the openQDC team will strive to provide a high quality curation and upload,
please be patient as the team will need to review the dataset and carry out the necessary steps to ensure the dataset is uploaded correctly.
